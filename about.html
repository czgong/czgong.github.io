        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <h2>Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            Chris Gong is a part of the <strong>class of 2023</strong> at Amherst College majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. Formerly part of the Men's
            Track and Field Team, Chris came to the difficult decision to leave after battling multiple injuries and to pursuit his other 
            goals while staying true to his academic studies.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Below, you will find what Chris likes to do in his free time. Although, because of a lack of freetime, resources, and
            stress-free state of mind during the school year, you will more often find Chris doing these hobbies during vacation - <em>sadly</em>.

                    <dd>Currently watching this one. Was hesitant at first since it was a bit older than the newer ones, but am starting to understand why
